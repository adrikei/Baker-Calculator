# "Baker" Calculator
iOS Calculator app based on Stanford's CS193P first and second lectures.

The entire course is available at iTunes U for free.

This calculator is meant to have very basic functionality and *is not* suitable for the 1st programming assignment of the course.
Its general goal is for me to get familiar with Xcode and iOS development practices.

The name is because that's how people in Brazil describe a very basic calculator, suitable only for very simple tasks, such as calculating change.
