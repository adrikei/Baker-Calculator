# Calculator
iOS Calculator app based on Stanford's CS193P first and second lectures.

The entire course is available at iTunes U for free.

This calculator is meant to have very basic functionality and *is not* suitable for the 1st programming assignment of the course.
Its general goal is for me to get familiar with Xcode and iOS development practices.
